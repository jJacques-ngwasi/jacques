I am an IT engineer in Uganda, originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Currently, I work as a full-stack JavaScript, CSS, and HTML developer. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology and programming, and I now pursue my programming objectives with VsCode, which is now my code editor of choice.
